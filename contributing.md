# Contributing Guidelines

- Add a single entry in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- If it exists, links to websites are prefered over store listings for apps.

- Pull request title should include entry's name and category.
  - Example: `[Addisfoodie] -> [Delivery Platform]`

- Provide a link to submitted entry in pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.
  - Example: `Link: https://addisfoodie.com/`

- Check if the entry is currently functional and made by Ethiopians.
