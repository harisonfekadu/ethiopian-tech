# Contributing Guidelines

- Add a single app/website in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- If an app has a website then it is prefered over store listing.

- Pull request title should include app/website name and category.
  - Example: `[Addisfoodie] -> [Delivery Platform]`

- Provide a link to submitted app/website in pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.
  - Example: `Link: https://addisfoodie.com/`

- Check if the app/website is currently functional and made by Ethiopians.
